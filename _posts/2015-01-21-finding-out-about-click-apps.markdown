Developers are busy writing Click apps for Ubuntu, but the app store is currently only accessible from the Store Scope shipped with Ubuntu Touch devices. So what if you don't own a device?

[The unofficial Ubuntu Touch Appstore][appstore-bhdouglas-com] lets you browse through the existing apps. You can search for keywords, filter results by category and sort them.

If you want to be notified about new apps or new releases of existing apps, pull [my app store feed][ubuntustorediff] into your feed reader. You can run a local copy of the script and customize it, as always the code is [on github][github-ubuntustorediff].
