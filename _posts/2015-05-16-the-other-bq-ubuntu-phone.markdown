After the flash sales ended, [bq][bq] told the world that there are no other Ubuntu Editions planned. Well, haven't they been a little too quiet on the phone front since then? Maybe like they were planning something?

1. Look at [this github repository][github-bq-e5], published a couple of days ago. It references a new codename, "vegetahd".

2. Look at [this system-image channel][system-image-ubuntu-vegetahd], which is already at version 5.

3. [Search Launchpad][launchpad-vegetahd] for "vegetahd".

Now where can I get an Aquaris E5 at this time of day ;)

*NOTE: Maybe you should pay more attention to things like [this][google-plus-vegeta].*
